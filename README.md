E-Canteen_project

This software system is a Canteen Management System for the students and faculty members of any college. This system will be designed to minimize the queues in the canteen and make hassle-free payments using the unique id provided to the students and the faculty by the college.

Overview:

The pages accessible by the customers include the home page(index.php), full menu (full_menu.php), login (customer_login), register (customer_register.php) and detail of the team(about_us.php)

There is also an admin access(admin_area) to add,remove products from the menu and keep a record of the orders. Basically it gives the admin a GUI to update the database.

'ecommerce.sql' contains the databse information . Import it into phpmyadmin to create the database.

The remaining folders contain the codes for the db connection, bootstrap, javascript,etc.

Any design improvements are highly appreciated!
